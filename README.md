Mellow D
========


### What is it?

A language (think programming language) for describing music. The compiler is passed in a MellowD source (`*.mlod` file) and outputs music in [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/), wav, or live playback form.


### Try it!

You can try MellowD right in your browser without downloading anything. Visit the editor at [https://spencerpark.github.io/mellowd-site/editor.html](https://spencerpark.github.io/mellowd-site/editor.html). The site for the editor is also [open source](https://github.com/SpencerPark/mellowd-site) for the most part if you would like to check out the source.


### Documentation

An interactive tutorial is in the works to make learning MellowD more enjoyable. This will be accompanied by some more concrete documentation as well.
