    //Staccato makes the performance short and choppy. Described in jazz
    //as `dit`. To achieve this effect the duration will be chopped to a
    //third of its value and the note will be ended very quickly.

    //Staccatissimo makes the performance short but more powerful. It is
    //given some more emphasis. It is similar to staccato but the duration
    //is going to be chopped to a half (rather than a third) and it will be
    //played with a bit more velocity.

    //Marcato is the same a staccato but with more power. It is referred to
    //as `dhat` by jazz musicians and to preform a note with articulated with marcato
    //the note's duration will be chopped to a third, the velocity will be increased
    //and the note will be release very quickly.

    //An accent is played by attacking the note. This gives it a much faster velocity and

    //Gliscando is a glide. It can be preformed as a pitch bend. To preform a gliscando a total of
    //16 pitch bend changes will give the effect that the note is falling or climbing (depending
    //on the direction of bend). These changes will be equally spaced over the duration of the note
    //as to not interfere with the next note. Additionally a reset message will be queued for the
    //next note to take.
